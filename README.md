# Project Overview

Square foot gardening is a method of gardening where plants are grown using a square foot grid system instead of rows. This program is intended to be a tool for planning and creating an optimal layout for a square foot garden

This project is an attempt to improve on a program that I wrote during my first year of programming. I remembered the idea of the project, but I had since deleted the source code so I wanted to recreate the project and improve the way that I wrote the code and what the program could do.
